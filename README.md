---- How to Play: Rules -------
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses X and the other O, taking turns to place their marks in empty squares. The objective is to be the first to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players alternate turns, and once a mark is placed, it cannot be moved. The game ends when one player achieves three in a row or when all squares are filled, resulting in a draw if no one wins. It’s a quick, strategic game that’s easy to learn and fun to play!
